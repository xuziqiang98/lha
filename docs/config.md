# Configuration

For basic configuration instructions, see [this documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-basic).

For advanced configuration instructions, see [this documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-advanced).

For a full configuration reference, see [this documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference).

## Connecting to MCP servers

Codex can connect to MCP servers configured in `~/.codey/config.toml`. See the configuration reference for the latest MCP server options:

- https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference

## Apps (Connectors)

Use `$` in the composer to insert a ChatGPT connector; the popover lists accessible
apps. The `/apps` command lists available and installed apps. Connected apps appear first
and are labeled as connected; others are marked as can be installed.

## Notify

Codex can run a notification hook when the agent finishes a turn. See the configuration reference for the latest notification settings:

- https://developers.openai.com/codex/config-reference

## JSON Schema

The generated JSON Schema for `config.toml` lives at `codex-rs/core/config.schema.json`.

## Custom Anthropic provider

You can configure a custom Anthropic-compatible provider with `wire_api = "messages"`:

```toml
model = "claude-sonnet-4-5"

[model_providers.anthropic]
name = "Anthropic"
base_url = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
env_key = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
wire_api = "messages"
```

You can also create this kind of provider from the TUI custom provider flows, including `/providers` and the first-run custom provider setup.

`wire_api = "messages"` does not support model discovery yet, so you must configure `model` explicitly.

By default, Codex sends `x-api-key` from `env_key` and injects `anthropic-version = "2023-06-01"` for this wire API. You can override the version header with `http_headers` or `env_http_headers` if needed.

## Notices

Codex stores "do not show again" flags for some UI prompts under the `[notice]` table.

Ctrl+C/Ctrl+D quitting uses a ~1 second double-press hint (`ctrl + c again to quit`).
